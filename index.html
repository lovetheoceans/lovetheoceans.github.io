		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever wonder why animal population rates are 
			dropping by so much? It's because the fish are dying.
			 The sea covers ~70% of the earth's surface, 
			 and 78% of animal biomass lives in there, it is 
			 incredibly important we protect it. An estimated 20 percent of the human population
			 get a large amount of their protein from the sea, but yet we are pouring tonnes and 
			 tonnes of plastic into the ocean.

		<h3>The problem:</h3>
		
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We created plastic in 1907, and yet in only 115 years, we
			have managed to utilise it in amazing ways, but we have also managed to use
			it to ruin our oceans. Think about fish. AN ocean sunfish eats jellyfish
