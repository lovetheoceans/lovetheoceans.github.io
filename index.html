			  <h1>Plastics in the Ocean</h1>
			  <p>And why they are bad</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<br>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever wonder why animal population rates are 
			dropping by so much? It's because the fish are dying.
			 The sea covers ~70% of the earth's surface, 
			 and 78% of animal biomass lives in there, it is 
			 incredibly important we protect it. An estimated 20 percent of the human population
			 get a large amount of their protein from the sea, but yet we are pouring tonnes and 
			 tonnes of plastic into the ocean. 
		</p>

		<br>

		<h3>The problem:</h3>
		
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We created plastic in 1907, and yet in only 115 years, we
			have managed to utilise it in amazing ways, but we have also managed to use
			it to ruin our oceans. Think about fish. An ocean sunfish eats jellyfish. A plastic
			bag looks like a jellyfish. The sunfish chokes on a plastic bag and dies. 
			Now imagine this x100,000. This is what happens every year because of humans 
			dumping at least 4.8 million tonnes of per year.
		</p>

		<br>

		<h3>The causes:</h3>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only cause of this is humans, but you can divide these
			humans into categories. The three countries who dump the most are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>China (21.5 billion kg)</li>
			<li>Brazil (10.6 billion kg)</li>
			<li>Indonesia (9.1 billion kg)</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The main industry causing plastic pollution is:
		</p>	

		<ul>
			<li>Packaging</li>
		</ul>	

		<br>

		<h3>The fixes:</h3>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to fix this problem, like
			banning one-use plastics (some countries are already doing this), putting a
			limit on how much plastic one product can contain, stopping people throwing plastic into
			the sea using law inforcement, putting nets over rivers, water cleaning stations in 
			large bodies of water and shutting down companies who are using too much plastic.
